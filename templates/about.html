    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came
        and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided
        to
        add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
        that
        someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
        Dwarves
        also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
        fourteenth to fill into their party.

                Fíli and Kíli were Dwarvern brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin
                Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
                
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly Bombur, they
                appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest of Thorin's companions,
                who are most often named only in group-reference.

            <p>
                Óin was a dwarf of Durin's Folk known for being a part of Thorin's Company in the Quest of Erebor.
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father
                of Balin and Dwalin.
                
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come
                along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire
                for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group.

                in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.
                
                Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring during
                the Council of Elrond.

                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
                accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisers.
                Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.
                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and
                he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as well
                as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a
                red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen companions.
